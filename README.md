# My_aws_s3bucket_boto3ClassificationProblem
## Project: My AWS S3 Bucket with Boto3 for Classification

## This project demonstrates how to upload and retrieve data from AWS S3 using Boto3, and apply a classification model.
## The main objective is to simulate a real-world MLOps workflow where large datasets and trained models are stored and managed in the cloud, ensuring scalability, accessibility, and version control across different environments or teams.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Boto3 – AWS SDK for Python to interact with S3.

Amazon S3 – Cloud object storage service.

Scikit-learn / TensorFlow – For training the classification model.

Pandas & NumPy – For data preprocessing.

Matplotlib / Seaborn – For data visualization and performance metrics.
